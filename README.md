# ChatterClient
Kotlin Multiplatform Chat app. 
This is my first experiment with Kotlin Multiplatform. Started doing it during my two day holidays. This project is simple client for websocket in https://github.com/Anoimar/TalksSocket . For now only displaying msg on Android client works.Will do the send part later. It seems KMP doesnt support websockets for iOS so doing this might be harder. Not sure if will do.
